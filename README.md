To use slash commands simply type / and a list of all slash commands in your guild/server will appear.
From there, select the command you want to run!

If you have lots of slash commands in your server, you can click the profile picture of your bot on the left side and all slash commands for your bot will appear!


# Config

{
    "Bot Token": "",
    "Prefix": "",
    "Staff Role ID": "",
    "Guild ID": "",
    "Log Channel ID": "",
    "Application Response Channel ID": "",

    "Applications": {
        "This is the name": ["I'm question 1!", "Question 2!", "And question 3!"],
        "Example": ["Whats your name?", "How old are you?", "Why do you want to be staff?", "What is your timezone?"]
    },

Then head over to Bot tab on the left side menu.

In the bot tab, click "Reset Token" and follow the instructions.

Once reset, copy the token which will appear and paste it into the "Bot Token" field in the config.json file!

# Setup


This bot is super simple to set up, simply follow these steps:

➤ Upload all files in "Murder Application Bot Free Version.zip" to your bots hosting.
➤ Fill out details in the config,json file.
➤ Turn the bot on (If your using online hosting, press "Start")
➤ Enjoy the bot 

For the simplicity of setting it up on your end, ensure you have all Privileged Gateway Intents which can be toggled at the Discord Developers Portal

Simply click the toggle on the right-hand side for the bottom three options on that page, i would recommend un-toggling the first option, "Public Bot" as this will allow anyone to add your bot to there server, and this bot is a server specific bot.
